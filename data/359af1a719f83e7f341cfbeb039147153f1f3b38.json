        "answer": "\n\n    React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012."

        "answer": "\n\n    The major features of React are:\n\n    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.\n    * Supports **server-side rendering**.\n    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.\n    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view."

        "question": "3. ## What is JSX?",
        "answer": "\n\n    *JSX* is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.\n\n    In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return(\n          <div>\n            <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>\n          </div>\n        )\n      }\n    }\n    ```"

        "id": 4,
        "question": "4. ## What is the difference between Element and Component?",
        "answer": "\n\n    An *Element* is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. *Elements* can contain other *Elements* in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.\n\n    The object representation of React Element would be as follows:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const element = React.createElement(\n      'div',\n      {id: 'login-btn'},\n      'Login'\n    )\n    ```\n\n    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:\n\n    ```\n    {\n      type: 'div',\n      props: {\n        children: 'Login',\n        id: 'login-btn'\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    And finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:\n\n    ```html\n    <div id='login-btn'>Login</div>\n    ```\n\n    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>\n      <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>Login</div>\n    ```\n\n    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(\n      'div',\n      { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },\n      'Login'\n    )\n    ```"

    {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "5. ## How to create components in React?",
        "answer": "\n\n    There are two possible ways to create a component.\n\n    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements:\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        function Greeting({ message }) {\n          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>\n\n        }\n        ```\n\n    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        class Greeting extends React.Component {\n          render() {\n            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>\n          }\n        }\n        ```"

        "answer": "\n\n    If the component needs *state or lifecycle methods* then use class component otherwise use function component.\n    *However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle  methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.*\n    *So, it is always recommended to use Function components, unless you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries *"

        "question": "7. ## What are Pure Components?",
        "answer": "\n\n    *`React.PureComponent`* is exactly the same as *`React.Component`* except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, *PureComponent* will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. *Component* on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called."

        "id": 8,
        "question": "8. ## What is state in React?",
        "answer": "\n\n    *State* of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.\n\n    Let's create a user component with message state,\n\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n\n        this.state = {\n          message: 'Welcome to React world'\n        }\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n          </div>\n        )\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ![state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions/359af1a719f83e7f341cfbeb039147153f1f3b38/images/state.jpg)\n\n    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it."

        "question": "9. ## What are props in React?",
        "answer": "\n\n    *Props* are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.\n\n    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\n\n    1. Pass custom data to your component.\n    2. Trigger state changes.\n    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.\n\n    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <Element reactProp={'1'} />\n    ```\n\n    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.\n\n    ```\n    props.reactProp\n    ```\n    \n\n    **Example: Props in Class Based Component**\n\n    ```jsx\n    import React from 'react'\n    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\n    class ChildComponent extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n            return (\n                <div>\n                    <p>{this.props.name}</p>\n                    <p>{this.props.age}</p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    class ParentComponent extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n            return (\n                <div>\n                    <ChildComponent name='John' age='30' />\n                    <ChildComponent name='Mary' age='25' />\n                </div>\n            )\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Example: Props in Functional Component**\n\n    ```jsx\n    import React from 'react'\n    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\n    const ChildComponent = (props) => {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <p>{props.name}</p>\n                <p>{props.age}</p>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n\n    const ParentComponent = () => {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <ChildComponent name='John' age='30' />\n                <ChildComponent name='Mary' age='25' />\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n    ```"

        "answer": "\n\n    Both *props* and *state* are plain JavaScript objects.

It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.\n\n    ```javascript\n    //Correct\n    this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in *constructor* or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax."

Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.\n\n    **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.\n\n    ```javascript\n    setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'))\n    ```"

        "answer": "\n    Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\n\n    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in *lowercase* as a convention:\n\n        ```html\n        <button onclick='activateLasers()'>\n        ```\n\n       Whereas in React it follows *camelCase* convention:\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        <button onClick={activateLasers}>\n        ```\n\n    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:\n\n        ```html\n        <a href='#' onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;' />\n        ```\n\n       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:\n\n        ```javascript\n        function handleClick(event) {\n          event.preventDefault()\n          console.log('The link was clicked.')\n        }\n        ```\n\n    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`\n       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"

        "question": "14. ## How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?",
        "answer": "\n\n    There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:\n\n    1.\t**Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.\n\n        ```javascript\n        class Foo extends Component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props);\n            this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n          }\n          handleClick() {\n            console.log('Click happened');\n          }\n          render() {\n            return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;\n          }\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n    2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then *public class fields syntax* can be used to correctly bind callbacks.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        handleClick = () => {\n          console.log('this is:', this)\n        }\n        ```\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n          {'Click me'}\n        </button>\n        ```\n\n    3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** You can use *arrow functions* directly in the callbacks.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        handleClick() {\n            console.log('Click happened');\n        }\n        render() {\n            return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click Me</button>;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or *public class fields syntax* approach considering performance."

        "answer": "\n\n    A `key` is a special string attribute you **should** include when creating arrays of elements. *Key* prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n\n    Most often we use ID from our data as *key*:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>\n      <li key={todo.id}>\n        {todo.text}\n      </li>\n    )\n    ```\n\n    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item *index* as a *key* as a last resort:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>\n      <li key={index}>\n        {todo.text}\n      </li>\n    )\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**\n\n    1. Using *indexes* for *keys* is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply *keys* on list component instead of `li` tag.\n    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items."

        "id": 20,
        "question": "20. ## How to create refs?",
        "answer": "\n\n    There are two approaches\n    1. This is a recently added approach. *Refs* are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use *refs* throughout the component, just assign the *ref* to the instance property within constructor.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props)\n            this.myRef = React.createRef()\n          }\n          render() {\n            return <div ref={this.myRef} />\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n    2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,\n        ```jsx harmony\n        class SearchBar extends Component {\n           constructor(props) {\n              super(props);\n              this.txtSearch = null;\n              this.state = { term: '' };\n              this.setInputSearchRef = e => {\n                 this.txtSearch = e;\n              }\n           }\n           onInputChange(event) {\n              this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });\n           }\n           render() {\n              return (\n                 <input\n                    value={this.state.term}\n                    onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}\n                    ref={this.setInputSearchRef} />\n              );\n           }\n        }\n        ```\n\n    You can also use *refs* in function components using **closures**.\n    **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach."

        "question": "23. ## Why are String Refs legacy?",
        "answer": "\n\n    If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because *string refs have below issues*, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.\n\n    1. They *force React to keep track of currently executing component*. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n    2. They are *not composable* — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n    3. They *don't work with static analysis* like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n    4.

        "answer": "\n\n    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\n    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n    1. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n    2. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n\n    3. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n\n    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\n    ![phases 16.4+](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions/359af1a719f83e7f341cfbeb039147153f1f3b38/images/phases16.4.png)\n\n    Before React 16.3\n\n    ![phases 16.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions/359af1a719f83e7f341cfbeb039147153f1f3b38/images/phases.png)"

The main reason for passing props parameter to `super()` call is to access `this.props` in your child constructors.\n\n    **Passing props:**\n\n    ```javascript\n    class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n\n        console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Not passing props:**\n\n    ```javascript\n    class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super()\n\n        console.log(this.props) // prints undefined\n\n        // but props parameter is still available\n        console.log(props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        // no difference outside constructor\n        console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The above code snippets reveals that `this.props` is different only within the constructor.

But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    componentDidMount() {\n      axios.get(`api/todos`)\n        .then((result) => {\n          this.setState({\n            messages: [...result.data]\n          })\n        })\n    }\n    ```"

It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.\n\n    ```js\n      const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {\n        /* render using props */\n      });\n      OR\n      export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);\n    ```"

We need to use object to map prop values to components.\n\n    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import HomePage from './HomePage'\n    import AboutPage from './AboutPage'\n    import ServicesPage from './ServicesPage'\n    import ContactPage from './ContactPage'\n\n    const PAGES = {\n      home: HomePage,\n      about: AboutPage,\n      services: ServicesPage,\n      contact: ContactPage\n    }\n\n    const Page = (props) => {\n      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage\n\n      return <Handler {...props} />\n    }\n\n    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.\n    Page.propTypes = {\n      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired\n    }\n    ```"

        "question": "82. ## Why we need to pass a function to setState()?",
        "answer": "\n\n    The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to  pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // assuming this.state.count === 0\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })\n    // this.state.count === 1, not 3\n    ```\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n    ```javascript\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      count: prevState.count + props.increment\n    }))\n    // this.state.count === 3 as expected\n    ```\n\n    **(OR)**\n\n    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?\n\n     React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n     This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n     ```javascript\n     // Wrong\n     this.setState({\n       counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n     })\n     ```\n\n     The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.\n\n     ```javascript\n     // Correct\n     this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n       counter: prevState.counter + props.increment\n     }))\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n\n    `React.StrictMode` is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like `<Fragment>`, `<StrictMode>` does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for *development mode* only.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import React from 'react'\n\n    function ExampleApplication() {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <Header />\n          <React.StrictMode>\n            <div>\n              <ComponentOne />\n              <ComponentTwo />\n            </div>\n          </React.StrictMode>\n          <Header />\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In the example above, the *strict mode* checks apply to `<ComponentOne>` and `<ComponentTwo>` components only."

        "answer": "\n\n    *Mixins* are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with *higher-order components* or *decorators*.\n\n    One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const PureRenderMixin = require('react-addons-pure-render-mixin')\n\n    const Button = React.createClass({\n      mixins: [PureRenderMixin],\n      // ...\n    })\n    ```\n    <!-- TODO: mixins are deprecated -->"

        "question": "85. ## Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?",
        "answer": "\n\n    The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (this.isMounted()) {\n      this.setState({...})\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\n    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting."

        "answer": "\n\n    *Pointer Events* provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens.

        "answer": "\n\n    If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class SomeComponent extends Component {\n     // Code goes here\n    }\n    ```\n    You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class myComponent extends Component {\n      render() {\n        return <div />\n      }\n    }\n\n    export default myComponent\n    ```\n\n    While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import MyComponent from './myComponent'\n    ```\n\n\n    #### What are the exceptions on React component naming?\n\n    The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.\n    For example, the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n         render() {\n              return (\n                <obj.component/> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`\n              )\n        }\n    ```"

        "answer": "\n\n    Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it.\n\n    For example, let's take a look at the below attribute:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <div mycustomattribute={'something'} />\n    ```\n\n    Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:\n\n    ```html\n    <div />\n    ```\n\n    In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:\n\n    ```html\n    <div mycustomattribute='something' />\n    ```\n\n    This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries."

        "answer": "\n     Below are the list of steps to get history object on React Router v4,\n\n     1. Create a module that exports a `history` object and import this module across the project.\n\n         For example, create `history.js` file:\n\n         ```javascript\n         import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history'\n\n         export default createBrowserHistory({\n           /* pass a configuration object here if needed */\n         })\n         ```\n\n     2. You should use the `<Router>` component instead of built-in routers. Import the above `history.js` inside `index.js` file:\n\n         ```jsx harmony\n         import { Router } from 'react-router-dom'\n         import history from './history'\n         import App from './App'\n\n         ReactDOM.render((\n           <Router history={history}>\n             <App />\n           </Router>\n         ), holder)\n         ```\n\n     3.

        "answer": "\n\n     Redux follows three fundamental principles:\n\n     1. **Single source of truth:** The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\n     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n     3. **Changes are made with pure functions:** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."

Those are as follows:\n\n     1. **You will need to learn to avoid mutations:** Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.\n     2. **You're going to have to carefully pick your packages:** While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.\n     3. **There is no nice Flow integration yet:** Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."

It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive.

        "answer": "\n\n     You need to write a *root reducer* in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.\n\n     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     })\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {\n         state = undefined\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action)\n     }\n     ```\n\n     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     })\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {\n         Object.keys(state).forEach(key => {\n           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`)\n         })\n\n         state = undefined\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action)\n     }\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n\n     Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could *reduce* a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state."

        "question": "167. ## What is the proper way to access Redux store?",
        "answer": "\n\n     The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called *Higher-Order Components*, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.\n\n     Let's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import { connect } from 'react-redux'\n     import { setVisibilityFilter } from '../actions'\n     import Link from '../components/Link'\n\n     const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n       active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter\n     })\n\n     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n       onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))\n     })\n\n     const FilterLink = connect(\n       mapStateToProps,\n       mapDispatchToProps\n     )(Link)\n\n     export default FilterLink\n     ```\n\n     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).\n\n     ```javascript\n     class MyComponent {\n       someMethod() {\n         doSomethingWith(this.context.store)\n       }\n     }\n     ```"

It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a `ReferenceError` immediately.\n\n     Normally we will save them in a single file (`constants.js` or `actionTypes.js`).\n\n     ```javascript\n     export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\n     export const DELETE_TODO = 'DELETE_TODO'\n     export const EDIT_TODO = 'EDIT_TODO'\n     export const COMPLETE_TODO = 'COMPLETE_TODO'\n     export const COMPLETE_ALL = 'COMPLETE_ALL'\n     export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = 'CLEAR_COMPLETED'\n     ```\n\n     In Redux, you use them in two places:\n\n     1. **During action creation:**\n\n         Let's take `actions.js`:\n\n         ```javascript\n         import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes';\n\n         export function addTodo(text) {\n           return { type: ADD_TODO, text }\n         }\n         ```\n\n     2. **In reducers:**\n\n         Let's create `reducer.js`:\n\n         ```javascript\n         import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes'\n\n         export default (state = [], action) => {\n           switch (action.type) {\n             case ADD_TODO:\n               return [\n                 ...state,\n                 {\n                   text: action.text,\n                   completed: false\n                 }\n               ];\n             default:\n               return state\n           }\n         }\n         ```"

        "answer": "\n     You need to follow below steps to use Polymer in React,\n\n     1. Create a Polymer element:\n\n         ```jsx harmony\n         <link rel='import' href='../../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html' />\n         Polymer({\n           is: 'calender-element',\n           ready: function() {\n             this.textContent = 'I am a calender'\n           }\n         })\n         ```\n\n     2. Create the Polymer component HTML tag by importing it in a HTML document, e.g. import it in the `index.html` of your React application:\n\n         ```html\n         <link rel='import' href='./src/polymer-components/calender-element.html'>\n         ```\n\n     3. Use that element in the JSX file:\n\n         ```javascript\n         import React from 'react'\n\n         class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n           render() {\n             return (\n               <calender-element />\n             )\n           }\n         }\n\n         export default MyComponent\n         ```"

        "question": "213. ## Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?",
        "answer": "\n\n     If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.\n\n     ```jsx\n     class UserForm extends Component {\n       handleSubmit = () => {\n         console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value)\n       }\n\n\n       render () {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <input\n              type='text'\n              ref={(input) => this.input = input} /> // Access DOM input in handle submit\n            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>\n          </form>\n        )\n      }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function\n\n     ```jsx\n     class UserForm extends Component {\n      handleSubmit = () => {\n        console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value)\n      }\n\n      setSearchInput = (input) => {\n        this.input = input\n      }\n\n      render () {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <input\n              type='text'\n              ref={this.setSearchInput} /> // Access DOM input in handle submit\n            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>\n          </form>\n        )\n      }\n     }\n     ```\n\n    **Note:** In React v16.3,"

        "answer": "\n\n     The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component. It  means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping, you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enable hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave differently."

        "question": "215. ## What are HOC factory implementations?",
        "answer": "\n     There are two main ways of implementing HOCs in React.\n\n     1. Props Proxy (PP) and\n     2. Inheritance Inversion (II).\n\n     But they follow different approaches for manipulating the *WrappedComponent*.\n\n     **Props Proxy**\n\n     In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name **Props Proxy**.\n\n     ```jsx\n\n     function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {\n      return class PP extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props}/>\n        }\n      }\n     }\n     ```\n     **Inheritance Inversion**\n\n     In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems **inverse**.\n\n     ```jsx\n     function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) {\n      return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent {\n        render() {\n          return super.render()\n        }\n      }\n     }\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     It is up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state.\n\n     Below are the thumb rules to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux\n     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?\n     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?\n     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?\n     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?\n     5.

        "answer": "\n\n     You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,\n\n     1. Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.\n     2. Call Hooks from React Functions only. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions."

        "answer": "\n     Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.\n     \n     React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.\n\n     If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement:\n\n     ```javascript\n     class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n       constructor(props) {\n         super(props);\n         this.state = { error: null };\n         this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n       }\n\n       handleClick() {\n         try {\n           // Do something that could throw\n         } catch (error) {\n           this.setState({ error });\n         }\n       }\n\n       render() {\n         if (this.state.error) {\n           return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>\n         }\n         return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n     Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn’t use error boundaries."

Below are the few listed in an order,\n     1. **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**\n        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.\n        ```javascript\n        render() {\n          // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render\n          // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2\n          const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);\n          // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!\n          return <EnhancedComponent />;\n        }\n        ```\n        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n\n     2. **Static methods must be copied over:**\n        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n        ```javascript\n        // Define a static method\n        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function() {/*...*/}\n        // Now apply a HOC\n        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);\n\n        // The enhanced component has no static method\n        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === 'undefined' // true\n        ```\n        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\n\n        ```javascript\n        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {\n          class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}\n          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(\n          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;\n          return Enhance;\n        }\n        ```\n     3. **Refs aren’t passed through:**\n        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API"

For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.\n\n     The below HOC logs all props,\n     \n     ```javascript\n         function logProps(Component) {\n           class LogProps extends React.Component {\n             componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n               console.log('old props:', prevProps);\n               console.log('new props:', this.props);\n             }\n\n             render() {\n               const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;\n\n               // Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref\n               return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;\n             }\n           }\n\n           return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n             return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;\n           });\n         }\n     ```\n\n     Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,\n\n     ```javascript\n         class FancyButton extends React.Component {\n           focus() {\n             // ...\n           }\n\n           // ...\n         }\n         export default logProps(FancyButton);\n     ```\n\n     Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.\n\n     ```javascript\n         import FancyButton from './FancyButton';\n\n         const ref = React.createRef();\n         ref.current.focus();\n         <FancyButton\n           label=\"Click Me\"\n           handleClick={handleClick}\n           ref={ref}\n         />;\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior."

        "answer": "\n     If you don’t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var Greeting = createReactClass({\n       getDefaultProps: function() {\n           return {\n             name: 'Jhohn'\n           };\n         },\n       getInitialState: function() {\n           return {message: this.props.message};\n         },\n       handleClick: function() {\n          console.log(this.state.message);\n       },\n       render: function() {\n         return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\n       }\n     });\n     ```\n     **Note:** If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use `.bind(this)` with in constructor for event handlers."

        "answer": "\n     Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`.\n\n     For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class Greeting extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return <div>Hello {this.props.message}</div>;\n       }\n     }\n\n     ReactDOM.render(\n       <Greeting message=\"World\" />,\n       document.getElementById('root')\n     );\n     ```\n\n     You can write the same code without JSX as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class Greeting extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return React.createElement('div', null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);\n       }\n     }\n\n     ReactDOM.render(\n       React.createElement(Greeting, {message: 'World'}, null),\n       document.getElementById('root')\n     );\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.\n\n     In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\n\n     1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.\n     2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."
    },
    {
        "id": 286,
        "question": "286. ## What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?",
        "answer": "\n     When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\n\n     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**\n        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example,  elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.\n     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n        ```javascript\n        <div className=\"show\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n\n        <div className=\"hide\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n        ```\n     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n     4. **Recursing On Children:**\n        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n        ```javascript\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n          <li>third</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        ```\n     5. **Handling keys:**\n     React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,\n     ```javascript\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2014\">Connecticut</li>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e,  Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse children={mouse => (\n       <p>The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}</p>\n     )}/>\n     ```\n\n     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse>\n       {mouse => (\n         <p>The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}</p>\n       )}\n     </Mouse>\n     ```\n\n     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.\n\n     ```javascript\n     Mouse.propTypes = {\n       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n     };\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method."

        "question": "290. ## How do you create HOC using render props?",
        "answer": "\n     You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a <Mouse> component, you could easily create one using a regular <Mouse> with a render prop.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function withMouse(Component) {\n       return class extends React.Component {\n         render() {\n           return (\n             <Mouse render={mouse => (\n               <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} />\n             )}/>\n           );\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern."

        "answer": "\n     No, you don’t have to learn es2015/es6 to learn react. But you may find many resources or React ecosystem uses ES6 extensively. Let's see some of the frequently used ES6 features,\n\n     1. **Destructuring:** To get props and use them in a component\n         ```javascript\n         // in es 5\n          var someData = this.props.someData\n          var dispatch = this.props.dispatch\n\n         // in es6\n         const { someData, dispatch } = this.props\n         ```\n     2. Spread operator: Helps in passing props down into a component\n         ```javascript\n         // in es 5\n         <SomeComponent someData={this.props.someData} dispatch={this.props.dispatch} />\n\n         // in es6\n         <SomeComponent {...this.props} />\n         ```\n     3. Arrow functions: Makes compact syntax\n         ```javascript\n         // es 5\n         var users = usersList.map(function (user) {\n          return <li>{user.name}</li>\n         })\n         // es 6\n         const users = usersList.map(user => <li>{user.name}</li>);\n         ```"

        "question": "317. ## What is Concurrent Rendering?",
        "answer": "\n     The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,\n\n     ```javascript\n     // 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode\n     <React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>\n       <Something />\n     </React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>\n\n     // 2. Whole app using createRoot\n     ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render(<App />);\n     ```"

        "answer": "\n     Imagine a simple UI component, such as a \"Like\" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.\n\n     The imperative way of doing this would be:\n\n     ```javascript\n     if( user.likes() ) {\n         if( hasBlue() ) {\n             removeBlue();\n             addGrey();\n         } else {\n             removeGrey();\n             addBlue();\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.\n\n     In contrast, the declarative approach would be:\n\n     ```javascript\n     if( this.state.liked ) {\n         return <blueLike />;\n     } else {\n         return <greyLike />;\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a sepecific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand."

        "answer": "\n                     \n        `State mutation` happens when you try to update the state of a component without actually using `setState` function. This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.\n\n        This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.\n\n        Ex:\n        ```javascript\n        class A extends React.component {\n          constructor(props) {\n            super(props);\n            this.state = {\n              loading: false\n            }\n         }\n\n        componentDidMount() {\n          let { loading } = this.state;\n          loading = (() => true)(); // Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable\n        }\n\n        ```\n\n        **How to prevent it:** Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using `setState` to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values."

        "answer": "\n  ## Class Component syntax\n\n\n ```\nclass Example extends Reacts.Component {\nrender(){\nreturn <h1>This is a class component</h1>}\n}\n\n```\n\n> I guess we all know that **Pascal Case** is the accepted way of naming a component in react`Example`. \n\n# Functional Component syntax\nFunctional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks\nHere is a syntax for functional component\n\n```\nfunction App(){\n   return <div className=\"App\">\n     <h1>Hello, I'm a Nigerian</h1>\n    </div>\n}\n\n```\n### States in Class Component \nstates holds information or data about a component in react which may change over time.  in class component we can update the state, when a user interacts with it or maybe a server response using the `setState()` method and the initial state is been assigned in the `Constructor( ) `method using the the  ` this.state` object. different data type can be passed in the this.state object, which can be string, boolean, numbers, etc. \n<strong> A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor() <strong>\n\n```\nclass Example extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      example: \"This is a class component\",\n    };\n  }\n  changeText() {\n    this.setState({\n      example: \"implementing the setState() in class component\",\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <h1>{this.state.example}</h1>\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            this.changeText();\n          }}>\n          Click!!\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n```\n## Using Sates in Functional Components\nInitially, we could not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. over the years hooks were implemented in functional component. The hooks that enable us to use state in functional component is called <strong>useState</strong>\n The useState( ) hook returns an array of the current state and a function ( setState) that we can use to update the value of the current state. The array is being destructured so we can can see the variables the array holds that is, the initial state and the updated state lets see an example\n\n \n\n```\nfunction App() {\n  const [country, setCountry] = useState(\"i'm a Nigerian\");\n  const change = () => {\n    setCountry(\"i am a Canadian\");\n  };\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Hello, {country} </h1>\n      <button onClick={change}>Change</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<h4> Props in Class Component</h4>\n Props are referred to as \"properties\".  props are passed into react component just like arguments are passed into functions . Props are being specified as attribute just like your html. for example if the name attribute is \"name \" we assign a value to name. so basically, props are object that contains an attribute and its corresponding value. Data can be passed from parent component to the children component, but this data is immutable, which means that we cannot modify the props across another  component. here is an example \n```\nclass Introduction extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1> Hello, my name is {this.props.name} </h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Introduction name=\" Queen Elizabeth\" />\n        <Introduction name=\" Margret  Edeh\" />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Props in Functional Components\n\nProps in functional components are similar to that of the class components, the difference is the absence of the 'this' keyword. We also destructure in a similar way without the 'this' keyword. they are also immutable in the functional component\n```\nfunction Food(props) {\n  return <h1>I love {props.fav}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Food fav=\"Beans\" />\n      <Food fav=\"Yam and Egg sauce\"/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n``` \n> As you can see in the example above there wasn't a need for the 'this' keyword.\n\n```\n\nfunction Food(props) {\n  const { fav } = props;\n  return <h1>I love {fav}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Food fav=\"Beans\" />\n      <Food fav=\"Yam and Egg sauce\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\nsummary:\n\n*The functional components doesn't require the render method          \n*Class component require the render() method that returns JSX.                                                  \n\nTo use states in functional component we use the **useState** hook.          \nTo use State in class components we use the constructor method and the setState function.\n                                     \nFunctional components use the useEffect hook instead of lifecycle method [useEffect](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_useeffect.asp )    \n Class components uses Lifecycle method    **componentWillUnmount** etc. [ Lifecycle methods](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp )\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies.
